# 🔄 Mini AMM DEX - Automated Market Maker

> A simplified decentralized exchange built for educational purposes as part of the Blockchain 1 (BC1) course

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Mini Automated Market Maker (AMM) Decentralized Exchange** that demonstrates core DeFi concepts. The DEX allows users to:

- 🔁 Swap ERC20 tokens using an AMM pricing model
- 💧 Provide liquidity to a token pair
- 💰 Earn fees from swaps proportionally to their liquidity share

Unlike a Fixed DEX, this project demonstrates **dynamic pricing based on token reserves**.

## 🧠 What is a Mini AMM?

A Mini AMM is a simplified version of popular AMM-based DEXs (like Uniswap), designed for educational purposes.

### 🔁 Core Formula

The exchange rate is calculated using the **constant product formula**:

```
x * y = k
```

Where:
- **x** = reserve of Token A
- **y** = reserve of Token B
- **k** = constant value

### Key Characteristics

✅ Dynamic price based on supply & demand  
✅ Liquidity pool instead of fixed prices  
✅ Swap fees rewarded to liquidity providers  
❌ No order book  
❌ No centralized price control

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### 🔹 ERC20 Tokens
- Two ERC20 tokens used for swapping (example: `aiMAUT` & `COFFEE`)
- Implemented using OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Standard ERC20 functionality

### 🔹 Mini AMM DEX Smart Contract
- Manages liquidity pools
- Executes swaps using `x * y = k`
- Collects swap fees
- Tracks liquidity providers

### 🔹 Development Environment
- Built and tested using **Hardhat**
- Local blockchain for fast testing

## 🔄 AMM Swap Logic

1️⃣ User provides liquidity (Token A + Token B)  
2️⃣ Liquidity is stored inside the AMM contract  
3️⃣ User calls `swap()`  
4️⃣ Smart contract:
   - Calculates output using AMM formula
   - Applies swap fee
   - Updates pool reserves  
5️⃣ Tokens are transferred automatically

---

## 💧 Liquidity Provider (LP) Logic

- Users deposit both tokens in a fixed ratio
- In return, they receive **LP shares**
- LPs earn:
  - Swap fees
  - Proportional ownership of the pool
- Liquidity can be withdrawn at any time

---

## 💼 Business Model

The Mini AMM DEX can generate value through:

- 💵 Swap fees (e.g. 0.3%)
- 🎁 Incentives for liquidity providers
- 🔗 Token pair onboarding
- 📚 Educational / testnet deployments

---

## 🚀 Current Status

✅ Hardhat project initialized  
✅ ERC20 tokens deployed  
✅ Mini AMM smart contract implemented  
✅ Liquidity pool working  
✅ Swap logic tested  
✅ Fee mechanism implemented
